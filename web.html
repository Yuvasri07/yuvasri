 <p>  Afforestation is the process of introducing trees and tree seedlings to an area that has previously not been forested. Afforestation can be done through tree planting and seeding, naturally or artificially. Similarly, reforestation can be considered a form of afforestation.

<u style="font-size:32px;word-spacing:1.5px;"/> Importance of Afforestation:</u>

<p> Afforestation helps to reduce the carbon emissions of the planet by trapping carbon in the form of Carbon Dioxide and utilizing it in photosynthesis to produce oxygen which is released into the atmosphere so that they may be used by all living organisms including humans.
ost importantly, afforestation is something which is very economical and easy. It can help in bringing back the balance of nature. Even if one community vows to practice afforestation.</br> we can successfully create a whole new forest. The first step has already been taken; various NGO’s and government agencies are already involved. We need to create awareness about its importance to make it happen on a bigger scale.

<h2>Purposes of Afforestation </h2>
<p> There are many reasons for restoring an area via afforestation and reforestation, however they vary based on the area. Generally it is done for either conservation or industrial-commercial purposes.

<li style="font-size:20px;word-spacing:1.5px;line-height:30px;"/><b style="font-size:25px;word-spacing:1.5px;"/>Conservational afforestation </b>and reforestation is done in the best interest of the ecosystem. Its purpose is to restore an area that has been destroyed due to previous overuse of the land or to reduce the amount of erosion in the soil in an area and establish a more fertile and stable soil base.

<p id="class"> Afforestation, reforestation and other forms of conservational forestry methods are often thought to be used for stopping the effects of climate change by reducing atmospheric carbon. The issue is which type of tree sequesters the most amount of carbon and does this have a positive or negative effect if any at all? The tree types that are widely discussed are old growth vs young-growth forests. Old growth forests are said to have massive carbon storage capabilities however these trees are capturing carbon incredibly slowly or unable to capture any more. With reforestation, this process is ‘solved’ by cutting down old growth and planting young-growth trees. Unfortunately, when an old growth forest is cut down, a lot of the stored carbon gets released into the atmosphere thus preventing a net positive effect. Afforestation is being thought of as a solution to the reforestation issue. By planting a new young-growth forest in an area that hasn’t previously had a forested, this could be a viable option for sequestering more carbon from the atmosphere. However, planting trees in an area previously unforested could impact the original ecosystem negatively such as reducing soil moisture in an area and forcing many species to leave their preferred habitats...

Those animals pushed from their natural habitats by human activities can relocate to the new forests. For this reason, afforestation can aid in protecting wild animals.

<h2>Plantation</h2>
<p>afforestation  particular, it is often not easy to distinguish between
afforestation and either rehabilitation of degraded forest ecosystems or enrichment planting, or
between plantation forests and various forms of trees on farms. The definition proposed by FAO to
the 1967 World Symposium on man-made forests and their industrial importance, which uses as its
criterion land use changes associated with afforestation or reforestation, has been the basis of
subsequent official estimates (eg Pandey 1995), and is adopted here for the sake of consistency.
However, any consideration of plantation forests should acknowledge that the distinction between vary foresation.</p></br>

<p>In the commercial world, the demand is usually high for a specific type of tree. Afforestation allows stakeholders to plant the type of trees in demand, promoting the fast propagation of specific types of trees. The introduction of new supply of trees, for instance, can help to stabilize the cottage industry resulting in stable prices and business reliability.</p>
<p>Planting trees is a proven way of transforming arid and semiarid areas. Places with more trees experience frequent rains, and thus, planting trees is a perfect way to stabilize climate. Trees also reduce the greenhouse effect preventing warmer temperatures as they are the world’s only natural air conditioners.</p>
