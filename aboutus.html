 <P>A forestation is the efforts to plant trees in barren lands, so as to create a forest. It is important because it helps to check the over use of natural resources by providing an alternative source pool. It is the process of planting trees, or sowing seeds, in a barren land devoid of any trees to create a forest. While reforestation is increasing the numbers of tree of an existing forest, afforestation is the creation of a new forest. Afforestation is highly important to maintain the biodiversity. In many governmental lands non-governmental organizations directly engage in programmes of afforestation to create forests, increase carbon capture and carbon sequestration and help to anthropogenically improve biodiversity.

</br>
<p>Afforestation is necessary to combat the issues of global warming, soil erosion, pollution, and the maintenance of biodiversity and ecological balances. Our earth has been constantly trying to cope with the way in which human beings use natural resources, clean forests lands, cut trees, and contaminate the air, land and water. Industrial revolution, population explosion and pollution create permanent damage to the earth, and the result is global warming and climate change. In such situations, something that can help extend the life of the planet and its living organism is the increase of natural resources, and decrease of exploitation of these resources</p>
</br>
<p>By planting tree and creating forests many of the commercial needs of human beings are fulfilled, but not destroying what is left of the planet. Afforestation is therefore a practice that has been propagated by government and non-governmental agencies of many countries as away to stop over-exploitation of nature. With the increasing demand for fuel wood and building materials, this process helps to meet these demands, without cutting down natural forest. Deforestation can be led to the depletion of tree in water catchments riverside zones. Afforestion ensures trees and plants that hold the soil in these sensitive areas remain protected.
</p></br>
<p>Many countries have introduced the practice of planting trees along with agricultural crops in croplands. There are benefits of this practice which is called agro-forestry.</p>
</p></br>
<p>In terms of environmental benefits, planting tree is always beneficial whether it takes place in barren lands or it is used as a method of regenerating a depleted forest. This helps to check atmospheric carbon-dioxide, large-scale afforestation can cub the problems caused due to burning of fossil fuel, industrialization and so on.
</p></br>

<p>Forests have significant role in reducing the risk of natural disaster, including flood, drought, landslide, and other extreme events. At global level, forests mitigate climate change through carbon sequestration, contribute to the balance of oxygen, carbon-dioxide and humidity in the air and protect watersheds, which supply 75 per cent of freshwater worldwide.
</p></br>
<p>Forests are more biologically diverse ecosystems on land, home to more than 80% of the terrestrial species of animals, plants, and insects. They also provide shelter, jobs, and security from forest dependent communities.

 <p>India has been implementing the afforestation programme throughout the country right from beginning of the introduction of Forests Conservation Act. The country initiated large-scale afforestation under the social forestry programme starting in the early 1980s. This includes community wood-lots, farm forestry, avenue plantations, and agro-forestry. The afforestation and reforestation in India are being carried out under various programmes, namely social forestry initiated in the early 1980s, Joint Forest Management Programme initiated in 1990, afforestation under National Afforestation and Eco-development Board (NAEB) programmes since 1992, and private farmer and industry initiated plantation forestry.

<p>Afforestation is a positive effort in cubing the over-use and destruction of natural forests. If it is done with proper planning and at appropriate sites, it can become a commercially viable solution for many human needs, without harming the balance of nature. In fact, we need to move beyond conservation to sustainable management of tree resources. But we can only do if we grow trees and then plant them again. This is what we need to discuss and what we need to work on in the coming years.
