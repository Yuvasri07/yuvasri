<p style="word-spacing:2px;line-height:40px;font-size:20px;"/>Over the last decade, the talk on global warming and climate change has dominated major events and conferences. Politicians and global leaders have campaigned under the idea of helping combat the issues of global warming. As such, afforestation has been one of the most talked-about methods of dealing with global warming.</p>
<p style="word-spacing:2px;line-height:40px;font-size:20px;"/>It refers to the process of sowing seeds or planting trees in an area that does not have trees to create a forest. According to the Vocabulary, afforestation is “the conversion of bare or cultivated land into forest.” However, afforestation should not be confused with reforestation. Reforestation refers to planting trees in a land with a decreasing number of trees.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;word-spacing:2.3px;line-height:40px;"/>Therefore, reforestation is the process of increasing trees in an existing forest, while afforestation is the process of creating a new forest. In this article, our aim is to look at the importance of afforestation and its various advantages.</p>
<b style="font-size:32px;"/>Importance of Afforesation</b>
</br></br>
<b style="color:blue;font-size:28px;"/>1.Provide an alternative source of tree products</b>
<p style="word-spacing:1.9px;line-height:40px;font-size:20px;"/>In today’s world, the rate at which trees grow naturally in forests is much slower than the rate at which trees in forests are being cut down for production. The increased demand for tree products has put pressure on forests resulting in deforestation.</p>
<p style="word-spacing:1.9px;line-height:40px;font-size:20px;"/>Afforestation is helping alleviate the pressure on natural forests by providing an alternative source of tree products. It is mostly done for commercial purposes.</p>
<b style="color:blue;font-size:28px;"/>2. Increased supply of trees that are in high
demand</b>
<p style="word-spacing:1.9px;line-height:40px;font-size:20px;"/>In the commercial world, the demand is usually high for a specific type of tree. Afforestation allows stakeholders to plant the type of trees in demand, promoting the fast propagation of specific types of trees. The introduction of new supply of trees, for instance, can help to stabilize the cottage industry resulting in stable prices and business reliability.</p>
</br>
<b style="color:blue;font-size:28px;"/>3. Protection of natural forests</b>
<p style="word-spacing:1.9px;line-height:40px;font-size:20px;"/>Protecting natural forests without providing alternative sources of tree products is very difficult and unsustainable. Besides, logging is more common in places where there are no alternative sources of tree products.</p>
</br>
<p style="word-spacing:1.9px;line-height:40px;font-size:20px;"/>However, when commercial tree users have alternative sources of supply, they can support the administrative and policy efforts in protecting forests, resulting in more sustainable initiatives. Protecting natural forests also leads to other benefits that come with increased tree forest cover like preservation of catchments, wetlands, and riverside zones.</p>
<b style="color:blue;font-size:28px;"/>4.Environmental Benefit</b>
<p style="word-spacing:1.9px;font-size:28px;font-size:20px;"/>Planting trees in a barren land is on some occasions more beneficial than planting trees in a depleted or depleting forest. Planting trees in a depleted or recovering forests helps to restore the ecosystem of the area, but planting trees in a barren land helps to create a new ecosystem.</p>
</br>
<p style="word-spacing:1.9px;line-height:40px;font-size:20px;"/>Most governments and institutions have used afforestation to help revert the arid and semi-arid areas to productive areas. It also helps improve the appearance of barren lands to picturesque areas.</p>
<b style="color:blue;font-size:28px;"/>5.Various Addition</b>
</br>
<p style="word-spacing:1.9px;line-height:40px;font-size:20px;">An easy way to transform a barren land is by planting trees. Land with trees is more attractive and valuable than barren land. Whether one is seeking to develop or sell property, planting trees is a sure way of increasing the property’s value.
